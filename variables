while we want to pass the variable into gitlab,

we can do it in two ways --- just variable or pass a file variable
with two options-
1. protect variable -- this will help to restrict variable to a particular branch
2. mask variable --- it will not be seen in logs



pre defined variables

#global variables
variables:
    name: 'John'
    message: 'How are you?'

display_message:
    variables:
        name: 'Mark'
    script:
        - echo "Hello $name, $message"
