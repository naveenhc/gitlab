while we want to pass the variable into gitlab,

we can do it in two ways --- just variable or pass a file variable




pre defined variables
demo_job:
  script:
    - echo $CI_COMMIT_MESSAGE
    - echo $CI_JOB_NAME

--
#global variables
variables:
    name: 'John'
    message: 'How are you?'

display_message:
    variables:
        name: 'Mark'
    script:
        - echo "Hello $name, $message"
---

secret variable

push_image:
    script:
        - docker login -u $USERNAME -p $PASSWORD
        - docker tag pyapp:latest $USERNAME/mypyapp:latest
        - docker push $USERNAME/mypyapp:latest
    tags: 
        - localshell
        - localrunner
